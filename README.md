# Walmart-Sales-Prediction

The study discusses Walmart's challenge in effectively forecasting sales and demand due to sales fluctuation caused by numerous occasions and holidays. The current machine learning algorithm has proven ineffective, leading to supply shortages brought on by unanticipated demand.  Despite limited historical data, the main challenge is calculating the impact of markdowns during holidays by creating Machine learning (ML) system that can effectively estimate demand to address this problem. The data set includes historical sales information from 45 Walmart locations across several geographies including store counts, sales by week, holiday flags, CPI,etc covering February 5, 2010, to November 1, 2012, sourced from Kaggle. The study involves dataset understanding, cleaning, regression model development to forecast sales based on variables, and model evaluation using metrics like R2 and RMSE. This research aims to offer insightful analysis and practical suggestions to improve Walmart's sales forecasting accuracy.
